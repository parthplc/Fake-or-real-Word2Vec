# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.
so we need to classify whether it is an actual disaster using tweets or a fake one.

# Word2Vec
Word2vec is a two-layer neural net that processes text by “vectorizing” words. Its input is a text corpus and its output is a set of vectors: feature vectors that represent words in that corpus. 
While Word2vec is not a deep neural network, it turns text into a numerical form that deep neural networks can understand.


So using word2vec we solve this problem.
